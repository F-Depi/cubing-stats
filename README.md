# cubing-stats
I thought it was a wise thing to start using phython (no offence to MATLAB), to keep track of all the data analisy of my training sessions with the Rubik's Cube (... a lot...) and to make some nice graphs to show.

Recently, I conducted a comparison on a session where I was alternatively solving edges on scrambles with odd and even parity to investigate whether doing UF-UR pseudoswap had any influence on my speed.
